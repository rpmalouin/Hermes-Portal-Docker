# Hermes Portal

[![tests](https://github.com/rpmalouin/Hermes-Portal-Docker/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rpmalouin/Hermes-Portal-Docker/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Two standard-library-only Python halves that grew into one repository: **the Hermes
Portal** — a read-only, eleven-domain drill-down over everything the running Hermes agent
keeps — and the **skill framework** it grew out of, for discovering, registering and
running *skills* (self-contained Python programs described by a `skill.json` manifest).

No pull requests, you are free to fork it, use it, enhance it on your own.

[Why it exists](#why-this-project) is the next section; [how to run
it](#how-to-use-this) — in Docker, or straight from a checkout — is the one after that. The
layout:

![The Hermes Portal index page, a demo instance: the eight skill tiles across the top, then a card per domain](/docs/screenshot.png)

*The page above is a demo instance -- a fixture Hermes home, not this machine, and the
`demo-*` agent names are fixtures too. The chip beside the title, `demo`, is that
instance's label: a portal names the machine it serves so that two of them are never
mistaken for each other (*`--label`*). `tools/demo_shot/` builds and captures it.*

## Why this project

Hermes knows a great deal about itself and shows almost none of it. Its skills live in
`SKILL.md` files across four roots; its conversations in a SQLite store with two FTS
indexes; its schedule in `jobs.json` and `executions.db`; its spend in a column on the
sessions table; its health in launchd, heartbeats and a ticker file; its logs in two
directories; what it remembers about you in `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` per profile; its
extensions in 105 plugin manifests; your notes in an Obsidian vault; and the shape of its
own code in a 2.5 GB code graph. Eleven sources, several formats, and no single place to look.

**The Hermes Portal is that place.** It answers one question well — *what is in there, and
can I go deeper?* — for all eleven at once, under four refusals that shape everything else:

* **Read-only over live data.** SQLite is opened `mode=ro` with `query_only`; files are
  read from the end; probes are GETs. The portal never writes to anything Hermes owns, so
  it is safe to leave open while the agent is working.
* **Standard library only.** No web framework, no template engine, no extra SQLite
  driver: `http.server`, `sqlite3` and string formatting. It runs from a checkout on a
  machine with nothing but Python 3.11+ — including the Linux box this is meant to be
  copied to.
* **Numbers carry their definitions.** Nothing shows a bare count: each names the rule
  that produced it, and competing counts sit side by side instead of one being quietly
  chosen. A count must be the size of the set its label describes — the project's standing
  invariant, and the bug that has bitten it most often.
* **It degrades, it does not fall over.** A missing source, a corrupt favourites file, a
  schema that moved, an adapter that raises: each becomes a note on the page and the rest
  keeps serving.

What it is *not*: an agent UI (Hermes' own dashboard and CLI do that), a writer, or a
monitoring daemon. It is a lens — one page of HTML and one document of JSON per view — so
that "what does the agent actually have?" is a click away instead of a research project.

The skill framework below it is the smaller half and the older code: the portal grew out
of it, and it stays useful on its own for discovering and running `skill.json` programs.

## How to use this

**Run the portal — as a container.** This repository is the Docker deployment: it ships
`compose.yaml` and the `Dockerfile`, and the image is standard-library Python 3.12 with
nothing installed but the code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rpmalouin/Hermes-Portal-Docker
cd Hermes-Portal-Docker
docker compose up -d --build          # then open http://127.0.0.1:8087
```

It needs two paths from you, and has a default for each, so an empty `.env` runs as-is:
`HERMES_HOME_PATH` (the Hermes home to read — `~/.hermes`) and `VAULT_PATH` (an Obsidian
vault; leave it unset if you have none). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to set either, the
published `PORTAL_PORT`, and `PORTAL_LABEL` — the name this instance shows in its header and
page title, which is how two portals are told apart.

Without compose, the same thing by hand:

```sh
docker build -t hermes-portal .
docker run -d --name hermes-portal -p 8087:8087 \
  -v "$HOME/.hermes":/hermes \
  -v "$HOME/Obsidian":/vault:ro \
  -v "$PWD/state":/state \
  hermes-portal \
  --hermes-home /hermes --vault /vault --state /state/state.json \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8087 --label "$(hostname)"
```

Three things about those mounts, because each one has a reason a reader would otherwise
guess wrong:

| Mount | Why |
| --- | --- |
| your Hermes home, read-**write** | every store is opened `mode=ro`, but SQLite needs the *directory* writable to read a WAL database whose `-shm` index is absent — a `:ro` bind fails with `unable to open database file` |
| `./state` | the portal's only write (the favourites document), kept out of the Hermes home |
| the vault, `:ro` | it is never written; a missing path is reported `MISSING` rather than as an error |

Publishing the port means the process binds `0.0.0.0`, which turns off the `Host`-header
allow-list and starts logging requests — read
[the security note](#what-it-does-about-being-a-local-server-holding-secrets) before putting
this anywhere but a host you control. To keep it loopback-only, drop `ports:` and run with
`--host 127.0.0.1`, and reach it through a tunnel or a reverse proxy.

**Or run it from a checkout** — the same code with no Docker, Python 3.11+, from the project
root:

```sh
python3 -m hermes.portal                    # http://127.0.0.1:8087
python3 -m hermes.portal --list             # print what it would serve, no server
python3 -m hermes.portal --no-state         # serve with writing switched off
python3 -m hermes.portal --label mac-mini   # name this instance
.venv/bin/hermes-portal --port 8087         # the installed console script
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8087`: a page per domain, a rail of starred records, a command
palette (`/` or `⌘K`) over everything, and eight folder tiles over the skill tree. Every
number on a page links to what produced it, and every page has a `.json` twin — so
anything you can see, you can also fetch:

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | the index: every domain's headline counts, favourites, the skill tiles |
| `/skills` `/sessions` `/cron` `/usage` `/health` `/logs` `/memory` `/plugins` `/vault` `/graph` `/agents` | eleven domains, one page each, filterable and drillable |
| `/<domain>/<id>` | one record, plus the collections behind it (a session's messages, a job's runs) |
| `/search?q=…` | cross-domain search; messages go through the FTS indexes |
| `/favorites` | the records you starred — the one thing the portal writes |
| `POST /refresh.json` | re-read every source; writes nothing (the ↻ button in the header) |
| `/<domain>.json`, `/index.json`, `/favorites.json`, `/search.json` | the same data, for scripting |

Filters live in the URL and combine: `?box=creative` (or a category path,
`?box=mlops/evaluation`), `?folder=Homelab`, `?kind=platform`, `?model=…`, `?profile=…`.

**Freshness.** Sessions, usage, cron, health, logs and the code graph are read when you load
the page. The vault, skills, memory and plugins are indexed **once per process** — they are the
expensive ones, and a page that silently re-read a 3 MB vault mid-request would be a surprise —
so the header carries a **↻ button** that drops those snapshots and re-reads. Every collection
stamps the `as of` time it was read (UTC), so a page always tells you how old it is.

Useful flags: `--vault` (which Obsidian vault; or set `$HERMES_VAULT`), `--graph-db` (which code graph),
`--profile` / `--all-profiles` (whose skills), `--hermes-home`, `--port`, `--host` (read
[the security note](#what-it-does-about-being-a-local-server-holding-secrets) before moving
off loopback), `--label` (which instance this is; defaults to the machine's hostname), `--no-state`.

**Run the skill framework** — the other half, if you came for skills:

```sh
python3 -m hermes.cli.shell      # the `hermes>` REPL: `skills`, `run <name> [--k v]`
.venv/bin/hermes                 # the installed script, from any directory
```

**Check it still works:**

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .    # 527 tests
uvx ruff@0.14.4 check .                       # lint, configured in pyproject.toml
```

Where to go next: the skill framework from [Requirements](#requirements) through
[Profiles](#profiles); the portal from [Web views](#web-views) to
[The rules the portal runs on](#the-rules-the-portal-runs-on); then
[Tests and checks](#tests-and-checks).

## Requirements

* **Docker** for the container path above (any recent Docker with Compose v2) — or
  **Python 3.11 or newer** (developed and verified on 3.12.1) to run it straight from a
  checkout.
* No third-party Python dependencies — both halves are standard library only. The image adds
  one OS package, `lsof`, which the health domain uses to list listening ports.

## Install (optional)

This section, and the one after it, are about the **skill framework** — the other half of the
repository. The portal itself needs nothing but Docker (see
[How to use this](#how-to-use-this)).

Running from the checkout needs nothing. To get the `hermes` console script:

```sh
cd <project-root>
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .        # editable install
.venv/bin/hermes                  # the same shell as `python -m hermes.cli.shell`
```

A non-editable wheel carries the skills and profiles as well
(`hermes/profiles/*.json` and `hermes/skills/*/*` are declared as package data in
`pyproject.toml`), so an installed copy lists and runs skills with no project
directory present.

## Quick start (the skill framework)

`python -m hermes.cli.shell` resolves the package from the current directory, so
run it from the project root — or use the installed `hermes` script, which works
from any directory:

```sh
cd <project-root>
python3 -m hermes.cli.shell
```

To run it from anywhere, put the project root on `PYTHONPATH`:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=<project-root> python3 -m hermes.cli.shell
```

Optional flags:

```sh
python3 -m hermes.cli.shell --root <dir-containing-skills>
python3 -m hermes.cli.shell --profile hermes/profiles/default.json
```

A real session (copied verbatim from a run):

```
$ python3 -m hermes.cli.shell
Hermes Portal skill shell -- type 'help' for commands, 'exit' to leave.
hermes> skills
NAME           BOX  TITLE
-------------  ---  -----
example_skill  dev  Example Skill
hermes> run example_skill --input "hello there"
input    : hello there
upper    : HELLO THERE
reversed : ereht olleh
length   : 11
return code: 0
hermes> run example_skill --input=world
input    : world
upper    : WORLD
reversed : dlrow
length   : 5
return code: 0
hermes> exit
```

## REPL commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `skills` | list every loaded skill: name, primary box, title |
| `run <skill> [--k v ...]` | run a skill, forwarding flags to its argv |
| `help` | print the command reference |
| `exit` / `quit` | leave the shell (Ctrl-D also works) |

Input is tokenised with `shlex.split`, so quoted arguments work. On success the
shell prints the skill's stdout; on failure it prints stderr; it always prints
the return code. Failures never kill the shell: an unknown skill, a bad flag or
unbalanced quotes are reported and the prompt returns.

## Flag rules

The same rules apply whether you call `Runtime.run()` or type into the shell.

| Value | argv produced |
| --- | --- |
| `--key value` | `["--key", "value"]` |
| `--key=value` | `["--key", "value"]` (use when the value starts with `-`) |
| `--flag` | `["--flag"]` — boolean `True` |
| repeated `--key` | `["--key", "a", "--key", "b"]` — list argument |
| flag omitted | boolean `False`, or the `skill.json` default |

`True`, `False` and `None` are never stringified: `True` becomes a bare flag,
`False`/`None` omit it entirely. `int`, `float` and `str` are rendered with
`str()`. List items repeat the flag once each, in order.

`timeout` is the one keyword the framework consumes rather than forwards:
`runtime.run("skill", timeout=30)` sets that call's timeout.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create the directory `hermes/skills/<skill_name>/`. **The directory name must
   match the manifest's `name` field** — the executor resolves entrypoints as
   `<skills_dir>/<name>/<entrypoint>`, and the loader warns when they disagree.

2. Add `hermes/skills/<skill_name>/skill.json` with every required field:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "word_count",
     "title": "Word Count",
     "description": "Counts words, lines and characters in a text input.",
     "primary_box": "dev",
     "raw_category": "text",
     "tags": ["text", "stats"],
     "entrypoint": "main.py",
     "args": { "input": "hello world" },
     "related": ["example_skill"]
   }
   ```

3. Add `hermes/skills/<skill_name>/main.py`. It is launched as a plain script
   with `sys.executable`, so it must be standard library only and must not
   import the `hermes` package (the skill directory, not the project root, is on
   `sys.path` when it runs). Use `argparse`, accept the flags declared in
   `args`, exit `0` on success:

   ```python
   """Count words, lines and characters in a text input."""

   from __future__ import annotations

   import argparse


   def main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int:
       """Print the word, line and character counts of --input."""
       parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="word_count")
       parser.add_argument("--input", required=True, help="text to measure")
       args = parser.parse_args(argv)
       print(f"words : {len(args.input.split())}")
       print(f"lines : {len(args.input.splitlines())}")
       print(f"chars : {len(args.input)}")
       return 0


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       raise SystemExit(main())
   ```

4. That is the whole registration step — `load_skills` discovers the directory
   automatically. Verify with `skills` and
   `run word_count --input "one two three"`.

## Running it from Python

`Runtime(root)` and the shell's `--root` take the directory that **contains**
`skills/`. For this repository that is `hermes/`, not the project root:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from hermes.core import Runtime

runtime = Runtime(Path("<project-root>/hermes"))   # loads hermes/skills
print(runtime.skills.names())                      # ['example_skill']

result = runtime.run("example_skill", input="hello")
print(result.stdout, end="")                       # the skill's report
print(result.returncode)                           # 0

# a project whose skills live somewhere else:
other = Runtime(Path("<some-project>"), skills_dir=Path("<some-project>/skills"))
```

Mistaking the project root for the skills root is not silent: the loader reports
the missing directory, names the `skills_dir=` fix in the warning, and returns an
empty registry instead of raising.

## Manifest field reference

Every field below is required. Validation is strict about *presence* and *type*
only, so extra keys are ignored and manifests stay forward compatible. A
manifest that fails validation is reported on stderr and skipped — it never
prevents the remaining skills from loading.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | str | Unique identifier, `snake_case`. Must match the directory name. Used by `run` and by the executor's path resolution. |
| `title` | str | Human-readable name, shown by `skills`. |
| `description` | str | One-line summary of what the skill does. |
| `primary_box` | str | Top-level category, e.g. `dev`, `media`, `ops`. Group with `SkillRegistry.by_box()`. |
| `raw_category` | str | Finer-grained category label. |
| `tags` | list[str] | Free-form search/label terms. |
| `entrypoint` | str | Path to the Python file *relative to the skill directory*, normally `main.py`. |
| `args` | dict | Argument name (without dashes) -> default value. Values may be `str`, `bool`, `int`, `float` or a list of those. |
| `related` | list[str] | Names of related skills. |

## Profiles

A profile is a small JSON document describing how to start the framework:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | str | Profile name. |
| `skills_dir` | str | Skills directory, resolved relative to the *package directory* — the parent of the `profiles` directory. |
| `timeout` | int | Default per-run timeout in seconds (optional, defaults to 60; must be positive). |

`Runtime.from_profile(path)` resolves `hermes/profiles/default.json` with
`"skills_dir": "skills"` to `hermes/skills`, and passes the profile timeout to
every skill it runs.

## Web views

There is now **one web server**: the portal (below). The Skill Deck was folded into
it -- its card grid and box dropdown are the portal's skills gallery -- so the module
`hermes/web/skill_deck.py`, the `python -m hermes.web.skill_deck` entry point and the
separate server are gone. What moved where:

| Was | Now |
| --- | --- |
| the deck's card grid + box dropdown | the portal's skills gallery (`display="cards"` + a `Picker`) |
| `skill_deck.discover_skills` / `resolve_hermes_roots` / `split_frontmatter` | `hermes/core/skill_trees.py` (view-free) |
| `skill_deck.filter_cards` (box **or** category path) | `skill_trees.filter_cards`, now used by the portal too, so `?box=mlops/evaluation` works there as well |
| `python -m hermes.web.skill_deck --box creative` | `python -m hermes.portal` then `/skills?box=creative` |
| `hermes-deck` | **retired** — with the deck folded in, it was only a second name for this same entry point |

One behaviour changed on purpose: a box filter that matches nothing used to be
silently ignored, which showed unfiltered skills under a filtered URL. It now
reports zero and says why. Skills are also no longer counted with this project's own
`example_skill` mixed in -- the portal shows what Hermes has, not what this repo ships.

**Skills gallery**

`/skills` is the deck's successor: one card per skill, a **Box** dropdown listing
every box with its count, and the filter in the URL (`?box=creative`,
`?box=mlops/evaluation` for a category path, repeatable). It keeps everything the
portal insists on -- the count's definition, the extra counts that differ from it,
the sources and the read time all stay on the page. The dropdown is drawn from the
*unfiltered* inventory, so every box stays reachable after one is applied, and a
filter the dropdown cannot offer (a category path, or a value that matched nothing)
is shown as a disabled "current filter" entry rather than being hidden.
## Hermes Portal

A second web view, and the start of the system around everything Hermes keeps.
Every **source** is opened read-only -- SQLite with `mode=ro` plus `query_only`, HTTP
probes as GETs, files read from the end -- and there is exactly **one** write in the
project: starring a record, which updates the portal's own state document and nothing
else. The one other POST that does anything is a refresh, which re-reads the sources and writes
nothing at all. Every other POST is refused by name.

```sh
python3 -m hermes.portal                 # http://127.0.0.1:8087
.venv/bin/hermes-portal --port 8087      # installed console script
python3 -m hermes.portal --list          # registry summary, no server
.venv/bin/hermes-portal --no-state       # serve with writing switched off
.venv/bin/hermes-portal --state /tmp/p.json   # put the favourites file elsewhere
.venv/bin/hermes-portal doctor           # check this machine's Hermes against the reads
```

The default is **127.0.0.1:8087**, deliberately: not 8080 (the retired deck's port,
which is now free and stays free) and not 9119 (Hermes' own dashboard). It binds
localhost only, and `--port 0` picks a free port when something else already holds
it.

### When Hermes changes

The portal reads a small, **declared** surface: the columns its adapters name, across six
tables in `state.db` and `cron/executions.db`, two tables in each agent's own `state.db`,
the tables the code graph keeps, and every `cron/jobs.json`. Hermes grows that surface
additively -- `SCHEMA_SQL` is its single source
of truth and a startup reconcile ADDs any missing column -- so a column the portal asks for
keeps working as the tables around it grow. What breaks is the other direction, and
`doctor` finds it before a page does:

```sh
.venv/bin/hermes-portal doctor          # ok / drift, with the likely candidate named
.venv/bin/hermes-portal doctor --json   # the same report, for an agent to act on
```

It reports and does **not** repair. A rename is a decision about what a number *means*, so
the fix belongs to you (or your agent) with the test suite as the net; a `0` invented by a
guessed mapping would be worse than the honest "unavailable" the pages already show. A
missing column is reported next to the columns that do exist, ranked by name similarity --
`declared column is gone; closest in this table: created_at (real), last_read_at (real)` --
and a timestamp whose *content* moved while its shape stayed the same is caught by sampling
values through the same parser the pages use.

Two limits worth knowing: the version stamps it prints are **hints, not contracts**
(`state.db` advances `schema_version` for data migrations, so a shape change can leave it
unmoved, and the cron store carries no stamp at all), and a green run covers the tables and
columns above plus the file-backed pages: each page's item count is held next to the number
of sources on disk -- counted through the adapter's own listing, never a second walk of the
same tree -- and the vault is sampled for the `[[` its link parser needs, so a vault that
carries the syntax and reads no link at all is drift rather than a quietly empty page. What
is still not covered: a log line's shape, links written in a syntax that leaves no `[[`
behind to point at, and value plausibility beyond whether the stamps parse. Exit code is `1`

### What it does about being a local server holding secrets

This page shows the agent's memory, its sessions, its vault and its logs, and it has no
login -- on a loopback socket a login would be theatre. Three things stand in for one:

* **The `Host` header must name a name this portal answers to**: the loopback names,
  plus whatever `--host` was given. Without that check any page you visit could
  re-resolve its own hostname to 127.0.0.1 and read everything here same-origin
  (DNS rebinding). A request with no `Host` at all passes, because browsers always send
  one -- only non-browser clients omit it, and they are not who rebinding fools.
* **Every response carries a policy**: `default-src 'none'` with inline script and style
  allowed (the page is one file), no framing, no referrers, `nosniff`, and a `Server:
  hermes-portal` header with no version on it.
* **`--host` says so out loud.** Bound to anything but loopback the portal prints a
  warning naming what is exposed, drops the `Host` check (the exposure was the
  operator's call) and *starts logging requests*: on loopback silence is right, off it
  an access log is the least a thing holding the agent's memory should leave behind.

One piece of containment worth knowing: **the tree-walking readers refuse a symlink that
leaves the tree.** A link inside the vault (or the log directory) pointing outside is
skipped and reported on the page, while a link that stays inside is followed -- because
one of the trees the portal reads, a profile's `skills/`, is itself made of symlinks.

The posture behind those has been attacked rather than asserted: path traversal against
a control id that is *proven* to resolve, script tags in every field that reaches a page,
SQL and FTS injection attempts, oversize bodies, wrong media types, hostile `Host`
headers, and a symlink carrying a canary out of the vault.

Eleven domains, each with collections, drill-down and search:

| Domain | Source | Reads | Headline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| skills | 4 skill roots (shared + 3 profiles) | `SKILL.md` trees, frontmatter, `references/` | 158 unique names — plus 422 files, 55 boxes, 4 roots |
| sessions | `state.db`, incl. the `messages_fts` and `messages_fts_trigram` indexes | `sessions`, `messages`; search runs through the indexes | 91 sessions — plus 9,504 messages, all searchable |
| cron | `cron/jobs.json`, `cron/executions.db`, `cron/output/` | jobs, runs, incidents, reports | 10 jobs — plus 1,000 executions |
| usage | `state.db` | `sessions`, `session_model_usage` | 87 priced sessions — $16.68 estimated, 30.0M in / 2.6M out tokens, 4,292 calls |
| health | `launchctl`, LaunchAgents plists, `state.db`, `lsof`, `cron/ticker_*`, file sizes | services, heartbeats, ports, tickers, storage | the services found — plus running/stale counts |
| logs | `$HERMES_HOME/logs`, `~/Library/Logs` | the last 200 KB of each file, error signatures | log files in scope — plus distinct signatures |
| vault | the Obsidian vault (`--vault`, else `$HERMES_VAULT`, else the author's `/Volumes/Data/MyObsidian`) | all notes indexed in memory, frontmatter, `[[wiki links]]`, checkboxes, the Kanban board | 763 notes — plus 1,116 links, 141 tags, 76 open items |
| graph | `.code-review-graph/graph.db` (`--graph-db`) | precomputed tables: communities, risk, flows; FTS for search | 38 communities — plus 170,971 nodes, 1.5M edges (cached count) |
| memory | `memories/MEMORY.md` and `USER.md`, per profile, plus `config.yaml`, plus the archives under `backups/` | every entry, split on the section sign, measured against its character budget; older copies with what changed since | 6 files over 3 profiles — 42 entries; one at 2,200/2,200; 2 archived copies from 2026-08-25 |
| plugins | `plugin.yaml` manifests under the bundled tree, `~/.hermes/plugins/`, each profile's, and `config.yaml` | names, kinds, versions, file lists, declared env vars and hooks | 105 plugins in 8 kinds; 41 declare requirements |
| agents | the root's and each agent's own `state.db` (sessions, `gateway_heartbeats`), each agent's `cron/jobs.json` | a roll-up per profile, cron per agent, and how fresh each store is | 6 agents — plus 107 sessions, 11 cron jobs (only the root schedules any) |

P0 was skills/sessions/cron; P1 added usage, health and logs; P2 the two heavy planes,
the vault and the code graph; P5 memory; P6 plugins; `agents` then closed the set, naming the
profiles the other ten read around. Every source is read-only; the only
write in the project is a favourite.

**Vault.** 763 notes totalling ~3 MB is small enough to index in one pass and keep in
memory, which buys the thing a folder listing cannot: **backlinks**. Open any note and
you see its frontmatter, its text, what it links to (and whether each target exists) and
what links back to it. Tags come from frontmatter; open work comes from two conventions,
because the vault has two — a checkbox line in an ordinary note is open while unchecked,
and a **Kanban card is open while its `Status` field is not done**, since the board's
checkboxes are not maintained. Reading the box alone reported 87 finished cards as open.

**Searching messages.** The portal's search now reaches what was *said*, not only the
titles of things. `messages_fts` answers first, ranked by relevance (`bm25`), and each hit
is an excerpt **around** the match with the terms marked — where it used to show the
message's first 200 characters, so a hit could display a paragraph that never mentions
your search. A search box is not FTS5 syntax, so user text is sanitised into quoted prefix
terms AND-ed together: `dashboard parser` finds messages containing both, and `-`, `"`,
`*`, `NEAR(` and friends are read as ordinary text rather than raising or meaning
something else. When the word index has nothing, the trigram index answers substrings
(`ashboa` finds `dashboard`), and with no index at all the query degrades to `LIKE` — each
path naming which index answered. The rendering escapes the excerpt and only then turns
the markers into `<mark>`, so a message's own text cannot inject anything. A **Recent
messages** collection on the sessions page makes the same corpus browsable.

That work also uncovered a bug in every domain: `Record.links` were built as
`(href, label)` and unpacked as `(label, href)`, so each detail link rendered with the URL
as its text and the human label as its href — `<a href="Its folder">/vault?folder=Homelab</a>`,
which navigated nowhere. The renderer matches the documented order now, and a test pins the
rendered markup.

**Domains are classes now, one at a time.** Each domain used to be a single
`build_domain` function holding a dozen nested closures over a `state` dict, and the
code-review graph priced that shape: the factory in `memory.py` reached **793 lines**,
`graph.py`'s 567, and most of the graph's "untested hotspots" were closures that no test
could call by name. `domains/base.py` now holds a `SnapshotDomain`: the snapshot is an
attribute read once behind a lock, helpers are named methods, and the plumbing to a
`Domain` is written once. `build_domain(hermes_home=...)` stays each module's entry point,
so this converts one domain per phase, worst first. `memory.py`: 1,323 lines became **1,061**
for the domain plus **319** for a new `memory_files.py` that owns the file format and the
history layer, and its 793-line factory is **12** lines. `graph.py` followed: its 567-line
factory is **9** lines, and since every query there is already narrow and indexed it takes
no snapshot at all — the base's snapshot machinery is optional, and the one slow number
(`count(*)` over 1.5M edges) keeps the TTL cache it already had. `plugins.py` is the
third: its 528-line factory is **9** lines, and it *lost* code in the move — the
`state: dict` cache the closure kept is now the base class's, so a whole hand-rolled
memo layer deleted itself rather than being rewritten.

**P12 finished it: all ten domains then in the tree are classes.** (The eleventh, `agents`,
arrived later and was a class from its first commit.) The last four factories were the biggest
left — `health` 486, `usage` 458, `sessions` 443, `vault` 438 — and then the two the code
graph never ranked because they sat under its 300-line threshold: `logs` 246 and `skills`
220. (A threshold is a floor, not an inventory: the graph orders the work, it does not
enumerate it.) `vault.py` was the only one with real machinery in its factory — a
hand-rolled `state` dict and a `threading.Lock` around a closure called `index()` — and
both are the base class's now, `index()` being `read()` behind `snapshot()`. The portal's
largest function is **114 lines**, down from 793.

By then the conversion was an `ast`-driven script rather than hand-mapping: signatures,
body ranges and the `Domain` wiring come from the parse tree, and bodies still move as
text so their formatting is untouched. Two things it had to learn: a factory whose first
parameter is not called `hermes_home` (`logs` takes `hermes_home_override`), and a local
that has to be renamed because the base class owns the name (`skills` kept its snapshot in
`snapshot`).

The conversion found a real bug in itself: those helpers take the snapshot they are
*handed*, because that is how a filtered view reaches them, and the first cut had them
fetch `self.snapshot()` instead — so `?profile=default` silently rendered every profile.
A test now pins that contract by calling the builder directly with a narrowed snapshot.

**Memory history.** "What did memory say last week" is answerable, and the interesting
part is *which* containers hold the answer. The per-profile `state-snapshots/*-pre-update/`
directories do **not** keep memories — each ships a `manifest.json` listing exactly what it
holds (state.db, config.yaml, cron/, a few databases), so the page reads that manifest and
says so rather than scanning 126 MB for files that were never there. The archives under
`<hermes root>/backups/*.zip` do keep them, so history comes from those: only the
`memories/MEMORY.md` and `memories/USER.md` members are read, **in memory** (nothing is
extracted, asserted by a test), and the `.env` sitting beside them in the same archive is
never opened — asserted with a secret in a fixture archive.

Each older copy gets a page: the archived text, and what moved since, split three ways.
Entries are matched by their title line first, then by word overlap (40%+), because an
entry whose opening line was rewritten otherwise reads as a removal plus an addition. On
this machine the real archive shows the memory was substantially rewritten over three
weeks — `+8 -9 ~1` — which is the honest reading, not a diff artefact: most unmatched
entries share under a third of their words with today's.

**Plugins.** What Hermes is extended with, read from `plugin.yaml` manifests **without
running any of it**: the domain never imports a plugin, never executes its code, and
never evaluates a manifest with a full YAML parser (a documented subset handles the
three shapes these files use). That is not a shortcut — a plugin is arbitrary Python,
and a page that renders an inventory must not import one; the fixture suite ships
plugins that write a marker file on import and asserts the marker never appears. It
reports the bundled tree and every user/profile plugins directory, the kind either
declared in the manifest or inferred from its container (and says which), the files a
plugin ships, and the environment variable **names** it needs — never a value: 41
manifests declare `requires_env`, and a neighbouring `.env` is one thing this domain
does not read. Enablement is deliberately not claimed: this config has no
`plugins.enabled` list, so the page says which plugins `known_plugin_toolsets` names
per surface instead of inventing an on/off boolean, and directories without a manifest
are listed as such rather than counted as plugins.

**Memory.** The two files Hermes keeps per profile -- `MEMORY.md` (its own notes) and
`USER.md` (who it is working with) -- with entries split on the section sign and each
file measured against the budget `config.yaml` sets (`memory_char_limit`,
`user_char_limit`). The budget is the reason the domain exists: a file on its limit
cannot take another entry, so the page leads with usage and says which file is full.
When the config does not name a limit it reports characters and says so rather than
inventing a percentage, `*.lock` files are counted and skipped, and the page notes that
a running session holds the copy of memory it loaded at start, which can be older than
the file. The profile picker reads only the profiles that actually have memories, and a
profile with none shows nothing and says which directory it looked in.

**Code graph.** A deliberately narrow adapter over a 2.5 GB store, shaped by two rules.
Prefer what the builders already computed: `risk_index`, `flows` and
`community_summaries` answer in milliseconds, whereas recomputing degrees or language
histograms with group-bys over 1.5M edges costs 2–4 seconds per query, so those are not
on the page at all. And count what is cheap, cache what is not: `count(*)` on nodes is
instant, on edges it takes 3.3 seconds, so it is computed once in a **background thread**
and the metric says `counting…` until it lands, stamped with when it was taken. The
graph's 34 MCP tools remain its interactive interface — semantic search, refactor
previews and impact analysis are theirs; what the portal adds is a stable, linkable read
of what the store contains. A graph node's page shows its edges out and in, its flow
memberships, its risk row and its community.

### The interface (P3)

The mockup's UI on top of real data, with one new idea: a record can be **starred**.

* **A refresh writes nothing.** `POST /refresh.json` drops the per-process snapshots so the next
  page re-reads every source; it is the header's ↻ button and the only way a page shows you an
  edit the portal had already cached.
* **Favourites are the portal's only write.** `POST /favorites.json` takes
  `{domain, id, action}` and updates `<hermes root>/portal/state.json` (override with
  `--state`, disable with `--no-state`). The request is validated in a fixed order --
  route, state, media type, body size, JSON, domain, record -- so a malformed request
  never reaches the filesystem, and writes are atomic (temp file plus `os.replace`,
  mode `0600`) so a crash cannot leave a half-written list. The title stored is the
  **record's** title, never the client's, so the file cannot be used as scratch space.
  Star buttons ship unpressed and hydrate from `GET /favorites.json`, which keeps the
  renderer free of state; with JavaScript off the portal still works unstarred.
* **The theme is a real light mode, not an inverted dark one.** One set of CSS custom
  properties per theme, chosen in `<head>` before first paint (saved choice, else the
  system preference), toggled from the header and remembered in `localStorage`.
* **Ctrl/⌘-K opens a command palette** over whatever is loaded (`/search.json`,
  debounced, `↑`/`↓`/Enter/Esc), and `/` opens it anywhere outside a text field. Every
  page also carries a right rail: usage totals, favourites, and each domain's headline
  count.
* **No app-mode window.** The mockup's final piece was a chrome-less window, which
  means launching a Chromium browser with `--app=`. This machine's default browser is
  not Chromium, so that would be a flag that silently does nothing; the theme toggle
  and the rail get the same effect inside a normal tab.
* **A filter has to exist in three places, or it does not exist.** `?folder=` was read by
  the vault domain and covered by a test, but `FILTER_KEYS` in `server.py` did not list it,
  so the server stripped it before the domain ever saw it — which made every folder tile a
  link to a page that ignored it. Found by checking the wire, not the domain.
* **The box tiles are curated, and they say so.** The tree has 55 boxes and 43 of them
  hold exactly one skill, so `taxonomy.py` arranges the real boxes into eight groups
  -- name, blurb, emoji and a CSS gradient, no image assets. The tiles are
  presentation and the counts are measurement: a group's number is the sum of its
  member boxes' counts, read from the skills domain's own `boxes` collection, so a
  tile cannot disagree with the skills page. The section prints its coverage
  ("8 groups over the 55 boxes the tree actually has, covering 55 of them and 158 of
  158 skills") and lists every box the mapping does *not* name, so a new box appears
  as ungrouped rather than vanishing into a total, and a renamed box is flagged as a
  stale mapping entry.

### Running it somewhere else

This portal resolves everything from `$HERMES_HOME`, so a copy on another machine
works with no configuration -- but two domains are macOS-shaped and degrade rather
than pretend:

| Domain | macOS-specific part | On another platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| health | `launchctl list`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` | finds nothing, reports 0 services with the sources marked `MISSING`; a `systemd` reader is the equivalent work |
| logs | also reads `~/Library/Logs/*.log` | reads `$HERMES_HOME/logs` only |
| vault | defaults to `$HERMES_VAULT`, else the author's `/Volumes/Data/MyObsidian` | pass `--vault <path>`, or it reports an empty vault |

In a container, three more things follow from the same shape. The Hermes home is mounted
read-**write** (the WAL reason in [How to use this](#how-to-use-this)); a published port
requires `--host 0.0.0.0` inside the container, since a port arrives on the container's own
address and never on its loopback; and the health domain's `ports` collection can only report
the sockets in the container's own network namespace -- on the host network it lists the
machine's real listeners instead. The image carries `lsof` for that collection; without it the
collection says so rather than guessing.

Everything else -- skills, sessions, cron, usage, the code graph, favourites -- is
resolved from the Hermes home and needs no platform code.

**Which instance is this?** Every page carries a label beside the brand and in its
document title, because a second portal on a second machine renders byte-for-byte the
same HTML otherwise -- two open tabs would be indistinguishable. The default is the
machine's hostname, which is why `--label` exists: a container's hostname is its
container id. The same `label` key rides on `/index.json`, `/<domain>.json`,
`/<domain>/<id>.json`, `/search.json` and `/favorites.json`, so a script talking to two
instances never has to guess which one answered.

**Usage** is the single home for cost and token rollups: totals, by day, by model,
by provider and the most expensive sessions (each linking into the sessions view that
filters to it). The sessions domain keeps the index and each session's own usage --
one number, one place, so the two cannot drift.

**Health** answers "is it alive right now" rather than "is it configured": each
service's plist is joined with live `launchctl` state and a TCP probe of the port it
declares, so you get `running · port 9119: listening · last exit -15` instead of a
guess. It also carries the gateway's heartbeats, the cron ticker stamps, every
listening port, and the size of the stores Hermes grows (state.db, its WAL,
snapshots, backups, the 2.3 GB code graph).

**Logs** reads only the end of each file (200 KB) and normalises error lines into
signatures -- timestamps, levels, ids and numbers stripped -- which is what turns
"834 error lines" into `MCP server 'obsidian' failed after N reconnection attempts
x2283`. Every line that reaches a page is **scrubbed** first, because logs are where
a pasted key or a bearer header ends up.

Routes: `/` index, `/<domain>` collections, `/<domain>/<id>` a record and the
collections behind it (a session's messages, a cron job's runs and reports), and
`/search?q=...` across domains. `?box=`, `?model=` and `?provider=` narrow a
domain, and every `.json` variant returns the same data — `/index.json`,
`/skills.json`, `/skills/python-project-scaffolding.json`, `/search.json?q=...`.

### The rules the portal runs on

* **A count is never a bare integer.** Every collection publishes its definition
  next to the number, and competing counts appear side by side: the skills domain
  shows 157 unique names *and* 421 files *and* 55 boxes, because each answers a
  different question. Where a page shows a capped list it says "showing N of M".
* **Every collection names its sources and read time**, and a missing source is
  marked `MISSING` rather than silently empty. Adapter failures become notes on
  the page — one broken domain cannot take the portal down.
* **The portal writes one file, and the blast radius is tested.** SQLite is
  opened `mode=ro` with `query_only`; the only writer is the favourites store, and a
  test hashes the whole fake Hermes tree around a POST to prove the change set is
  exactly `portal/state.json`. Reading never creates the file, so a read-only home
  still serves (stars simply do not persist, and the page says so); `--no-state`
  turns writing off entirely.
* **Per-profile stores are disclosed, not merged.** Profiles keep their own
  `state.db` and `cron/executions.db`; the sessions page says so (2 sessions in
  the running profile, 6 in another) instead of quietly reading one of them.
* **Log text is scrubbed before it is rendered.** `sk-…`, `Bearer …`, `api_key=…`,
  `token=` and `password:` shapes become `<redacted>` on every path that shows free
  text, and signatures are built from scrubbed lines because a signature becomes a
  record *title* — masking only the body would still leak.
* **A count is the size of the set it describes.** Three P1 overviews shipped
  counting a five-record sample while meaning "32 files" or "87 sessions"; a test now
  asserts, for every collection in a fake registry, that the count equals the records
  shown when nothing is capped, and never falls below them.
* **Anything outside the process is patched in tests.** `launchctl`, `lsof` and
  `~/Library/Logs` are mocked, so the suite says the same thing on any machine.

Domains and views are separate: `hermes/portal/domains/<domain>.py` is one adapter
(Domain -> Collection -> Record), `hermes/portal/render.py` is one generic page
shape over that vocabulary, and a new domain is a new module plus a line in
`default_registry()`. P1 adds usage/health/logs; P2 the vault and the code graph
through its own MCP tools.

## Tests and checks

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .        # 527 tests, ~50s, no install needed
uvx ruff@0.14.4 check .                           # lint, configured in pyproject.toml
uvx ruff@0.14.4 format --check .

# five deliberately broken Hermes fixtures, served and crawled route by route:
python3 tools/drift_check.py

# the page's controls are JavaScript, so they need a browser to be sure of:
node tools/click_check.js http://127.0.0.1:8087/  # needs a Chromium on the CDP port
```

All three run in CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`). The suite runs on **3.11 and 3.12 on Linux**
— where the only macOS-shaped code (the two health probes and the vault default) is patched, so a
green run there is real portability evidence — and the browser check runs in its own job after
them, because no assertion about markup, headers or responses can tell you whether a button
works. Two bugs proved that: a CSP that blocked `/app.js`, and a script that ran before the
elements it wires existed. Both shipped green through a 400-test suite.

```sh
python3 -m unittest tests.test_smoke              # one module
python3 tests/test_smoke.py                       # works directly too

# through the installed package, from an unrelated cwd:
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s <project-root>/tests -t <project-root>
.venv/bin/hermes                                  # console script, any cwd
```

The suite is hermetic: the only subprocesses are Python interpreters, the only
writes go to `tempfile` sandboxes, and no test reads the network or a real
terminal.

Lint settings ship in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.ruff]` with
`select = ["E","W","F","I","UP","B","SIM","C4","RET","ARG","PTH"]`). Ruff is
**not** a project dependency — nothing in the tree imports anything outside the
standard library — so run it ephemerally if you do not have it installed:

```sh
uvx ruff check .            # reads the config from pyproject.toml
uvx ruff format --check .
```

## Return codes and error reporting

Skills return their own exit status. The framework uses distinct codes when it
cannot complete the run itself, mirroring shell conventions:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Skill succeeded. |
| other `> 0` | The skill's own exit status (the example skill uses `2` for a missing `--input`). |
| `-1` | Timeout; `stderr` is set to `timeout`. |
| `126` | The process could not be launched. |
| `127` | The entrypoint file does not exist. |

Loader problems (malformed JSON, missing field, wrong type, unreadable file,
name/directory mismatch, duplicate skill name) are one-line `warning:` messages
on stderr; the offending skill is skipped and startup continues.

## Specification notes

This tree was generated from a written specification; these are the places where
it had to be interpreted, all of them deliberate:

* **Target directory.** The spec named `/Volumes/Development/Hermes-Dashboard`,
  a volume that does not exist on the generation host (and `/Volumes` is not
  writable without `sudo`). The tree was written to the developer's project root
  as `Hermes-Dashboard`, keeping the spec's own spelling; the spec's other
  spelling, `HermesDashboard`, refers to the same tree. **Renamed to
  `Hermes-Portal` on 2026-09-17**: the old name read as a second Hermes
  dashboard beside the one Hermes already ships on 9119, which this never was.
* **Packaging came later, on request.** The spec listed an exact tree, so the
  first pass shipped without `pyproject.toml`, `LICENSE` or `.gitignore`. They
  were added afterwards; no file from the specified tree changed shape to
  accommodate them, and `python -m hermes.cli.shell` still runs uninstalled.
* **Extensions kept inside the specified files.** `load_profile()` and
  `Runtime.from_profile()` exist so `profiles/default.json` is functional rather
  than decorative; `Runtime` gained optional `skills_dir`/`timeout` keywords
  (with no arguments it behaves exactly as specified); the shell's `main()`
  accepts `--root`/`--profile` so it can be pointed at another tree. None of
  these add files to the tree.
* **Flag rendering for `None`.** The spec listed `str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`/list;
  `None` is treated like `False` and omits the flag.
* **Extra return codes `126`/`127`.** The spec only fixed `-1` for timeouts; the
  launch-failure and missing-entrypoint cases return data instead of raising, so
  the runtime can keep going.
* **Loader warnings beyond the spec.** A manifest whose `name` disagrees with its
  directory name loads but warns, because such a skill could never be executed.
